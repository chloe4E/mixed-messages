# mixed-messages
Project based on a codecademy exercise

## Exercise guidelines

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Personal approach outline

To tackle this exercise I chose to proceed with 

1. JavaScript 
+ create a list of random list of messages
As requested they shall have 3 parts able to mix and match, hence I will create :
10 contextual subparts
10 action subparts
10 complement subparts
all fo these will mix and match to create inspirational sentences

+ the mechanism to mix and match
I will use 3 switch statements with 3 random inputs to generate different sentences

2. html-css interface
+ to showcase the project to the user I'd like to create a simple interface where the user could click on a button to get his/her/their daily inspiration
